# Building a SOC Lab at Home

## Objective 
The SOC Home Lab project focused on setting up a controlled environment for network communication and security analysis. The primary goal was to configure and establish a virtualized network using Windows 10 and Kali Linux VMs, enabling practical cybersecurity exercises such as network monitoring and threat detection. This hands-on setup helped build foundational skills in network security and system configuration.  

## Skills Learned  
- Configuring virtualized environments using VirtualBox.  
- Network setup and troubleshooting, including static IP assignment.  
- Understanding internal networking between Windows and Linux systems.  
- Verifying connectivity and analyzing network communication.  
- Establishing a foundational lab for security testing and analysis.  


### Tools Used
- VirtualBox for virtualization
- Windows 10 VM as the host machine
- Kali Linux VM as the attacking machine

## Steps
### 1. Download VirtualBox
### 2. Download a Windows 10 Virtual Machine
### 3. Download Kali Linux Virtual Machine
### 4. Configure the Windows 10 VM Settings
- Changing the Network to Internal Network and set name for the network

### 5. Configure the Kali Linux VM Settings
- Changing the Network to Internal Network and set to the same internal network as the Windows 10 VM
