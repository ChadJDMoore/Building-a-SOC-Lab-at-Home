# Building a SOC Lab at Home

## Objective 
The SOC Home Lab project focused on setting up a controlled environment for network communication and security analysis. The primary goal was to configure and establish a virtualized network using Windows 10 and Kali Linux VMs, enabling practical cybersecurity exercises such as network monitoring and threat detection. This hands-on setup helped build foundational skills in network security and system configuration.  

## Skills Learned  
- Configuring virtualized environments using VirtualBox.  
- Network setup and troubleshooting, including static IP assignment.  
- Understanding internal networking between Windows and Linux systems.  
- Verifying connectivity and analyzing network communication.  
- Establishing a foundational lab for security testing and analysis.  


### Tools Used
[Bullet Points - Remove this afterwards]

- Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for log ingestion and analysis.
- Network analysis tools (such as Wireshark) for capturing and examining network traffic.
- Telemetry generation tools to create realistic network traffic and attack scenarios.
